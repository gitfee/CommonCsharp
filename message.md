We deployed couple of changes of batchreport project, including a new lable added, logs output etc. It turned out that the changes all are not take effect in newly deployed versions, we are not sure why this happend in recent hours, could anyone please help to check out if there was anhything wrong with build system or deployment tool?


I made couple of changes deployed to beta just a few minutes before, thinking that the issue should be fixed.Please have a test if you get chance later.
